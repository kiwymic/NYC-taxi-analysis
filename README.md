# NYC-taxi-analysis

The file consists of the following files.

1. R analysis: all in the `NYC_taxicab` folder
  - `csv_processing.R`: did a little in parsing the csv file into multiple files by random sampling.
  - `leaflet_test.R`: GIS mapping, some csv file processing and dataframe cleaning, test code for the leaflet
  - `city_level_analysis.R`: More feature processing, together with some EDA, which most of them are now in the app.
2. The shiny R project related code
  - three files `ui.R`, `server.R`, `global.R` in the `NYC_taxicab` folder
